# Code of Conduct

## Our standards

We want a friendly, professional community.

Examples of positive behavior:

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intent and focus on the technical issue
- Provide actionable feedback

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Publishing private information
- Spam or deliberately disruptive behavior

## Scope

This applies to project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions) and related community interactions.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may edit/remove content and restrict participation when behavior violates this policy.

If you need to report a conduct issue, use a private channel (e.g., GitHub Security Advisories) when appropriate.
